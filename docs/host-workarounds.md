<!-- Purpose: the ledger of host defects this engine works around, one entry per defect, keyed so a site comment can name it and the host-workarounds lane can hold the two in step. -->
# Host workarounds

The engine runs on hosts it does not own: SWI-Prolog, Janus, the C toolchain
and the operating system. When a host does something the engine has to work
around, the workaround is recorded twice and checked in both directions:

- at the site, a comment line in the file's own comment syntax of the shape
  `Workaround: <key> - <what this site does instead>`, followed by whatever
  explanation the site needs, where `<key>` is a heading in this file;
- here, one entry per defect under `## <key>`, with the fields below.

`tests/checks/check_host_workarounds.py`, the `host-workarounds` gate lane,
refuses a site whose key has no entry, an entry no site carries, an entry
missing a field, and a malformed site line. It then RUNS every entry's
reproduction on the host this tree runs on and reads the last line it prints:
`present` means the defect is still there and the workaround still earns its
keep; `absent` means the host no longer has it, and the lane fails naming
every site to lift, which is the signal to remove the workaround and the
entry together. Anything else is a broken reproduction and fails too. A
reproduction is a `.pl` file run as `swipl -q -f none -s FILE -g main -t halt`
or a `.sh` file run as `sh FILE`, under `bounded.sh`, with
`HOST_WORKAROUND_SCRATCH` naming a fresh directory of its own and `SWIPL`
naming the interpreter.

The fields, one per line, continuation lines indented:

- `Host:` the host and version the defect was measured on, with the source
  location that shows it.
- `Defect:` what the host does, stated as a mechanism.
- `Reproduction:` the tracked file whose last output line answers `present`
  or `absent`.
- `Workaround:` the shape every site uses, when there is one; each site
  states its own.
- `Lifted when:` the host change that makes the reproduction answer `absent`.
- `Record:` the journal thread that holds the evidence.

An entry lands with its first site and its reproduction in the same commit. A
site the ledger does not know is refused, and so is an entry nothing uses. The
journal keeps the history; this file holds only what is live.

## swi-cleanup-window
Host: SWI-Prolog 10.1.13; `setup_call_cleanup/3` is `sig_atomic(Setup),
  '$call_cleanup'` (boot/init.pl:680-682).
Defect: one call port lies between Setup returning and the cleanup being
  registered. An inference limit that trips at that port unwinds with Setup's
  effects in place and no cleanup owed, and a cleanup of several goals can be
  cut between its goals the same way. A signal cannot do this, because
  `sig_atomic/1` defers it; an inference limit is not a signal.
Reproduction: tests/checks/host_workarounds/swi-cleanup-window.pl, a budget
  sweep over an asserted guard; budget 4 of 64 leaks on 10.1.13.
Workaround: state that must not outlive its scope is a trailed write,
  `b_setval/2` on entry, `nb_setval/2` on the ordinary exit and `b_getval/2`
  to read; unwinding the exception unwinds the trail, so the cleanup is the
  fast ordinary exit rather than the thing correctness rests on.
Lifted when: the cleanup is registered before the call port that follows
  Setup, or the inference check honours the atomic region.

  20,000-budget sweep; docs/journal/2026-09-10-every-host-workaround-is-commented.md.

## swi-locale-default-encoding
Host: SWI-Prolog 10.1.13; the default source encoding follows `setlocale()`.
Defect: a boot under `LC_ALL=C` reads a UTF-8 source as single bytes and
  compiles each non-ASCII character to U+FFFD. A `.qlf` written by that boot
  outlives the locale, since its mtime is newer than every source, so every
  later boot under a correct locale serves the poisoned compile; and an ASCII
  output stream does not fail on the mark, it escapes it.
Reproduction: tests/checks/host_workarounds/swi-locale-default-encoding.sh,
  which reads an atom written as U+2705 back under `LC_ALL=C`.
Workaround: the encoding flag and both standard streams are pinned to UTF-8
  before any file loads, and the artifact stamp carries the encoding beside
  the version, so a set compiled under another one is purged.
Lifted when: SWI reads source files as UTF-8 whatever the locale says.
Record: docs/journal/2026-09-07-the-gate-green-again.md, the artifact that
  outlived its locale.

## swi-qlf-extension-spec
Host: SWI-Prolog 10.1.13; `'$qlf_file'/5` in boot/init.pl decides by the
  shape of the spec.
Defect: a `load_files/2` spec that names its `.pl` extension compiles from
  source whatever `qcompile(auto)` says; only a bare stem reaches the artifact
  rule, which loads the `.qlf` when it is fresh and version-compatible and
  rewrites it when it is stale and the directory is writable.
Reproduction: tests/checks/host_workarounds/swi-qlf-extension-spec.sh, which
  loads one unit as `'one.pl'` and another as `two` and looks for the
  artifacts.
Workaround: `metta_load_source/2` strips the extension of a source the boot
  claims, so every runtime unit reaches the artifact rule.
Lifted when: the artifact rule applies to an extension-bearing spec too.
Record: docs/journal/2026-09-09-runtime-units-compile-beside-their-source.md.

## swi-query-frame-discarded-on-engine-destroy
Host: SWI-Prolog 10.1.13; `PL_close_query` in src/pl-wam.c closes the
  foreign frame before discarding the outer query frame, while
  `prolog_frame_attribute/3` marks inspected ancestors for `frame_finished`.
Defect: destroying a yielded engine delivers the event for that discarded
  outer frame. Opening the listener's query aborts on the host's assertion
  `PL_open_query: Assertion failed: (void*)fli_context > (void*)environment_frame`,
  exit 134 in the plain-host reproduction. The same path under the engine
  exits 139 when the crash reporter itself segfaults. A build without
  assertions reads a discarded frame instead; exit 0 there is not proof
  that the defect has gone.
Reproduction: tests/checks/host_workarounds/swi-query-frame-discarded-on-engine-destroy.sh,
  a frozen unsafe ancestor walk inside a plain-SWI transaction, followed by
  an engine yield and destruction. It loads no repository engine predicates.
  Exit 139, or 134 with the exact assertion above, answers `present`; exit 0
  answers `absent`; every other result is a broken reproduction.
Workaround: inspect only through the nearest live transaction frame and
  transfer its watch to the surviving transaction when it finishes. Exclude
  the finished frame ID because failure notification can start on that frame.
Lifted when: SWI no longer delivers `frame_finished` for the frame that
  `PL_close_query` discards, or excludes its outer query frame from
  `prolog_frame_attribute/3` marking. Verify that host change before treating
  `absent` from a build without assertions as a lift signal.

  before native query destruction.

## swi-file-search-cache-sweep
Host: SWI-Prolog 10.1.13; boot/init.pl:1531-1564,
  https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl-devel/blob/fc7ef84b949378b729052c3ade79c90ce5416abb/boot/init.pl#L1531-L1564.
Defect: the first library load after the file-search cache expires runs
  gc_file_search_cache/1, removing other expired lookup entries. The next
  lookup pays resolution and insertion work instead of the warm-cache cost;
  wall-clock state changes measured Prolog inferences. A zero timeout bypasses
  insertion and the sweep, so it tests an uncached walk rather than this event.
Reproduction: tests/checks/host_workarounds/swi-file-search-cache-sweep.pl,
  ages cache and sweep timestamps under a positive timeout, loads a previously
  unloaded library, and compares the next lookup with two warm lookups.
Workaround: extensions/python/tools/twin_coverage.py sets
  file_search_cache_time to 9223372036854775807 before MeTTa boot, so every
  measured child and its inherited engines keep the cache live for the lane.
Lifted when: the aged load's next lookup costs the same inferences as a warm
  lookup; the reproduction then answers absent instead of the current 818
  against 680. Unequal warm controls or a reversed difference are broken.

  controls and the 2026-09-10 host-reproduction section.

## swi-first-arg-index-dead-keys
Host: SWI-Prolog 10.1.13; next_clause_primary_index in src/pl-index.c:293-346
  and the clause-collection contract in src/pl-proc.c:2248-2276,
  https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl-devel/blob/fc7ef84b949378b729052c3ade79c90ce5416abb/src/pl-index.c#L293-L346.
Defect: retract leaves dead ClauseRef keys in the primary index until clause
  collection. A bound lookup for the sole live tail scans the retired keys;
  the physical scan grows although Prolog reports the same inference count.
Reproduction: tests/checks/host_workarounds/swi-first-arg-index-dead-keys.pl,
  retains 20000 retired rows, measures live-tail lookups, then collects clauses
  and measures the same lookups twice. Automatic collection is held off only
  in this fresh diagnostic process so it cannot erase the inspected state.
Workaround: extensions/cmetta/bridge.pl keeps cursor owners under one static
  recorded key; the C handle carries a bound record reference, and close erases
  the owner immediately instead of retracting a dynamic cursor row.
Lifted when: retained-key lookups cost no more than four times the collected
  control, so the reproduction answers absent. Unequal inference counts or
  a fourfold spread between collected controls report a broken reproduction.
Record: docs/journal/2026-09-07-merged-tree-reconciliations.md, immediate cursor
  retirement and the 2026-09-10 host-reproduction section.

## swi-inherited-empty-predicate-retry
Host: SWI-Prolog 10.1.13; S_VIRGIN in src/pl-vmi.c:3244-3270,
  https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl-devel/blob/fc7ef84b949378b729052c3ade79c90ce5416abb/src/pl-vmi.c#L3244-L3270.
Defect: resolving a first inherited call retries and increments inferences
  when the provider's first-clause pointer is nonnull, even when every clause
  is retired. Clause collection clears that pointer and removes the retry,
  so identical logical state has a different first-call cost by GC schedule.
Reproduction: tests/checks/host_workarounds/swi-inherited-empty-predicate-retry.pl,
  compares inherited first/warm calls with retained and collected clauses in
  fresh plain-SWI processes, with direct provider calls controlling both arms.
Workaround: translator:runnable_head_awaits_its_definition/1 calls
  filereader:source_pending_definition/2 explicitly. The reader remains the
  same unique provider; no collection or counter adjustment enters the path.
Lifted when: inherited first-call counts agree in both states; the reproduction
  then answers absent. Currently retained reads4/3 and collected3/3, while
  direct calls read3/3 in both states. Inconsistent warm or direct controls,
  reversed costs and child failures are broken reproductions.

  buffered VM trace and unchanged-body foldall controls.
